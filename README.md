# Tutorial: Simplifying Slim3 Routing
This is the source code for the [youtube video](https://youtu.be/LUOM9TqMfsY) I posted demonstrating how one might clean up their routing by moving a lot of it to within the controllers.


## Usage
To get started, navigate to within the `before` and `after` folder and run a composer install to install the necessary packages.

```
composer install
```

Then if you want to test it, the easiest way is to just run the built in webserver for php and have all requests go to the index.php file:

```
php -S localhost:80 index.php
```
